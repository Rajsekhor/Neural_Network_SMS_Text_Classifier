# Neural_Network_SMS_Text_Classifier

This is a project provided by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

In this model, we were given a dataset that contains data on ham and spam messages. Our model was able to detect whether the message of the test set is spam or ham with utmost accuracy
To build the model, I took reference from multiple sites and project of fellow peers.

In this challenge, you need to create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
